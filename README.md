4. ERC6551 & ERC1155 NFT contract deployed through hardhat
5. Integration with EVM blockchain network for NFT minting and transactions
6. OpenAI AI models for natural language content generation and analysis
7. OpenAI AI models for text to speech and speech to text integration
8. Pinecone for storing vectorized syllabi and content embeddings
9. Google Auth for user authentication and Google Youtube API for youtube video generation


While we've made efforts to ensure the security of our project, we acknowledge that due to the nature of the hackathon, it may not be as robust or secure as a fully developed product. We encourage users to keep this in mind.

This project offers a thrilling dive into the capabilities of these technologies, and we're keenly anticipating its evolution. Your insights and recommendations are highly valued
